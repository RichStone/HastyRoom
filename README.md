# HastyRoom

This is a text-based room game. 

There are usable and unusable objects in a single room. 
There is also an enemy, like your wife or something, who is getting nearer every time you take an action. 

You have to find or to do something before she reaches your flat. 

You can win the game through the interaction with the objects and solving puzzles.
